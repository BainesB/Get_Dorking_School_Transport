This is a script that I've used to import some historic transport data. 

It was provided to me in the form of an MS excel doc 

I did this to provide the BID group with some Summary data of transport patterns for Dorking UK. 

The the town has an issue with AM traffic and we noticed that this is not a problem during the 
school summer break.

I'm making a case for investment in Dutch style transpor infra. This means that throw out the year 
local will have the option to move around on foot and by bike. This will me that the traffic has no
effect on retailors as customers will still be able to access the town. 

As yet I have not been provide with upto date school transport survey data, or the school travel plans 
for any of Dorkings schools.
